            <p> Introduction: Sophomore studying Software Engineering,
                Cybersecurity Engineering, Computer Science, AI,
                and Applied AI. Member of HACC Club. Working to develope a strong foundation in logical thinking,
                organization,
                and analytical skills, while gaining exposure to designing and evaluating systems that prioritize
                usability and efficiency. I enjoy approaching projects thoughtfully, focusing on structure, clarity, and
                continuous improvement. </p>

                <h3>Expense Tracker</h3>
                <p> In SE 1860, I worked together in a group to create a simple web-based expense tracker that allows me to add, view, filter, and delete
                    personal expenses. I created the interface that lets the user enter an expense name, amount, and category, then
                    automatically displays each expense with its details and updates the total amount spent. I used
                    JavaScript and HTML to handle expense management, filtering, and real-time updates. The layout is styled with embedded CSS
                    to keep the design clean, responsive, and easy to use. It is visible on my GitHub profile.</p>
